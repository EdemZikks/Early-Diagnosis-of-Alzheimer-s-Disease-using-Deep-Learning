# Early-Diagnosis-of-Alzheimer-s-Disease-using-Deep-Learning
Overview
This repository contains the code and resources for an academic project focused on the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) using deep learning techniques. Alzheimer's Disease is a neurodegenerative condition that impacts millions of individuals worldwide, and early diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and care planning.

Project Highlights
Deep Learning Models: The study implemented and compared several deep learning models, including modified VGG19, to analyze neuroimaging data for the early detection of Alzheimer's Disease.

High Accuracy: The proposed model achieved an impressive accuracy rate of 99.08% on the test dataset, demonstrating its potential as a diagnostic tool.

Data Preprocessing: The project includes comprehensive data preprocessing techniques to prepare the neuroimaging data for model training, ensuring data quality and reliability.

Model Evaluation: Stratified cross-validation was used to rigorously evaluate the performance of our models, providing insights into their generalization capabilities.
